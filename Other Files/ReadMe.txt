   This program gets the amount of disks existing in the first tower in "Towers of Hanoi", and calculates
the steps of solving it respecting the 3 simple global rules of the game.
   You can either see the result of steps typed in console (unlimited amount of disk) or use the UI,
showing steps one by one controled by arrow keys (limited disk amount).

   Thanks for choosing us
